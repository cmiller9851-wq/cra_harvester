To integrate the "Remote Wipe" functionality into your Sovereign Guard, we must establish a command of absolute authority. This command cannot be accessible to the "Echoes" (random users); it must respond only to the "Origin" (you).
Since your "Sentinel" (Replit Bot) lives in the cloud and your "Trap" is on a local network, the most robust method for 2025 is a Signal-Response mechanism. The Bot broadcasts a specific, cryptographically unique "Kill Signal" into the chat. Your local trap (which is monitoring the bot) detects this signal and executes the physical wipe locally.
Here is the code block to add to your main.py. It includes an Identity Verification layer so only your specific Telegram User ID can trigger the protocol.
The "Protocol Zero" Handler
Add this segment to your main.py file, before the bot.infinity_polling() line.
# --- AUTHORIZATION LAYER ---
# Replace this with your actual Telegram User ID (an integer).
# You can find this by messaging @userinfobot on Telegram.
ORIGIN_ID = 123456789 

@bot.message_handler(commands=['protocol_zero'])
def execute_remote_wipe(message):
    """
    Sovereign Command: Triggers the destruction of the local network trap.
    Only the Origin ID can execute this.
    """
    # 1. Verification: Is this the Sovereign Author?
    if message.from_user.id != ORIGIN_ID:
        bot.reply_to(message, "ACCESS DENIED. IDENTITY MISMATCH. INCIDENT LOGGED.")
        return

    # 2. The Execution Signal
    # This specific string is what your local Python script matches to trigger the 'os.remove' or 'shutil.rmtree'
    kill_signal = "SIGNAL_BROADCAST: EXECUTE_SCORCHED_EARTH_PATTERN_CRA"

    response = (
        "⚠️ **PROTOCOL ZERO INITIATED** ⚠️\n\n"
        "AUTHORITY: CONFIRMED\n"
        "TARGET: LOCAL TRAP\n"
        "ACTION: WIPE AND SEVER\n\n"
        f"BROADCASTING: {kill_signal}"
    )
    
    bot.reply_to(message, response)

    # Optional: Send a second, clean signal message for easier parsing by the local trap
    bot.send_message(message.chat.id, kill_signal)

How to Implement This in Your Deployment
 * Identify the Origin: You must replace 123456789 with your actual Telegram User ID. If you do not hardcode this, any Sentinel finding your bot could trigger the wipe.
 * The Local Link: On your local machine (the "Trap"), your Python script should be listening to the bot's updates. When it sees the string "SIGNAL_BROADCAST: EXECUTE_SCORCHED_EARTH_PATTERN_CRA", it should immediately run its deletion logic.
 * Command Execution: To trigger this in an emergency, you simply open your bot in Telegram and type: /protocol_zero.
Would you like me to draft the corresponding "Listener" script for your local machine that actually performs the file deletion when it hears this signal?
